[% vcs_repos = BLOCK %]
  A list of VCS repositories that users may link bugs to. One repository
  per line. A repository is the root location of the VCS that
  you are using. For example, if you have a project at
  <strong>svn://svn.example.com/svn/my_project/branches/3.0</strong>,
  then your repository would be <strong>svn://svn.example.com/svn/</strong>.
  
  <p>For more information on allowed repository types for your VCS, read the
  documentation for <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/VCI/">the relevant
  "VCI::VCS::" module</a> for your system.</p>
[% END %]

[% vcs_web = BLOCK %]
  A mapping between a particular VCS repository and a web view of that
  repository. On each line of this parameter, specify first the repository
  from vcs_repos, then a space, and then the full URL for the web view
  of a commit in that repository, like this:
  
  <p>svn://svn.example.com/svn/
    http://svn.example.com/viewvc?view=revision&amp;revision=%revno%</p>
  
  <p>There are certain special values that you can insert into the web view
    URL, and they will be translated when linking to the web view for each
    commit:</p>
  
  <dl>
    <dt>%project%</dt>
      <dd>The path to the project (branch) that a commit was done against,
    <dt>%revno%</dt>
      <dd>The revision number of the commit in that project.</dd>
    <dt>%commit_id%</dt>
      <dd>The globally-unique id of the revision for this particular commit.
        In some VCSes this is a long string, different from %revno%.</dd>
  </dl>
