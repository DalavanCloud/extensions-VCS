0.1 Aug 28, 2010
    - First release.
    - Shows Commit info on show_bug.cgi.
    - Has sync.pl, a script to sync existing commits into Bugzilla.
    - Has hook.pl, a script to help in writing VCS hooks that update
      Bugzilla.
    - Adds the VCS.add_commit WebService method.
    - Supports CVS, Svn, Hg, and Bzr. Git is also theoretically
      supported. However, the Git driver is not taint-safe, and so will
      throw errors if run in a normal Bugzilla environment.
