    - The extension wasn't working on 3.6 due to an error about
      REQUIRED_CREATE_FIELDS.
    - The extension now understands that identical commits on different
      branches are the same commit, at least for the distributed VCSes
      like Bzr, Git, and Hg.

    - First release.
    - Shows Commit info on show_bug.cgi.
    - Has sync.pl, a script to sync existing commits into Bugzilla.
    - Has hook.pl, a script to help in writing VCS hooks that update
      Bugzilla.
    - Adds the VCS.add_commit WebService method.
    - Supports CVS, Svn, Hg, and Bzr. Git is also theoretically
      supported. However, the Git driver is not taint-safe, and so will
      throw errors if run in a normal Bugzilla environment.
