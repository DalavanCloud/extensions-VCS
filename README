Installation
------------
This extension can be installed on Bugzilla 3.6.1 or any later version,
like this:

1. Move this directory (the "VCS" directory) into the "extensions" directory
   in your Bugzilla installation. Note that parts of your Bugzilla may
   now become non-functional until you finish the installation instructions.
2. Go to your Bugzilla directory and run ./checksetup.pl
3. Follow all of the instructions that checksetup.pl prints. You will
   probably have to install some Perl modules and then re-run 
   checksetup.pl again.
